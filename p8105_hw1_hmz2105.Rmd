#Problem 1: This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

To start, download the penguins dataset in the console directly.

Next, call in moderndrive and tidyverse library.

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load early_january_weather dataset.

```{r dataset}
data("early_january_weather")
```

Examine the dataset using the help and View functions.

```{r dataset help and view, eval = FALSE}
help(early_january_weather)
View(early_january_weather)
```
