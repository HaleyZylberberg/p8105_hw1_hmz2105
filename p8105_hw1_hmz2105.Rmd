#Problem 1: This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

To start, download the penguins dataset in the console directly.

Next, call in moderndrive and tidyverse library.

```{r setup}
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load early_january_weather dataset.
```{r dataset}
data("early_january_weather")
```

Examine the dataset using the help and View functions.

```{r dataset help and view, eval = FALSE}
help(early_january_weather)
View(early_january_weather)
```

The dataset 'Early January Weather' depicts the hourly meterological data for the airport `r unique(early_january_weather$origin)` for the month of January 2013. There are  `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns (i.e. variables) in the dataset. The variable names are `r names(early_january_weather)`.
