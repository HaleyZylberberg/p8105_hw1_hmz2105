\#Problem 1: This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting,
and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

To start, download the penguins dataset in the console directly.

Next, call in moderndrive and tidyverse library.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load early_january_weather dataset.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Examine the dataset using the help and View functions.

``` r
help(early_january_weather)
View(early_january_weather)
```

The dataset ‘Early January Weather’ depicts the hourly meterological
data for the airport EWR for the month of January 2013. There are 358
rows and 15 columns (i.e. variables) in the dataset. The variable names
are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

- The following are summary statistics:
  - The mean temperature in F is 39.5821229 (SD 7.058637), with minimum
    value 24.08 and maximum value 57.92.
  - The mean dewpoint in F is 28.057095 ( SD 10.7260695), with minimum
    value 8.96 and maximum value 53.06.
  - The mean humidity is 65.4767039 (SD 18.9453049), with minimum value
    32.86 and maximum value 100.
  - The mean wind speed in mph is 8.2258269 (SD 4.6116356), with minimum
    value 0 and maximum value 24.16638.
  - The mean precipitation in inches is 0.0020391 (SD 0.0132008), with
    minimum value 0 and maximum value 0.19.
  - The mean visibility in miles is 8.5153352 (SD 2.9971051), with
    minimum value 0.12 and maximum value 10.
  - Statistics could not be obtained for the variables wind gust, wind
    direction, and pressure due to missing variables (308 missing values
    for wind gust, 5 missing values for wind direction, and 38 missing
    values for pressure).
